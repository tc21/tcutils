""" Important note: The modules folder contains only one module,
    the tc module, which itself is useless, and contains the actual
    modules. These modules are all considered development in-progress
    and provide no command-line interface or dependency specification.

    It is intended that any tool in this module either gets developed
    into an individual module or never exit development phase.

    However, it is also acceptable that a module may require one of these
    modules as a dependency, especially when tc.utilities matures.
